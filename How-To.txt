Welcome to my Computer Vision for Blood Cells Detection using YOLOv7 repository! To see the code in action, please follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine (code availabe in notebook).
Open the 'YOLOv7-For-Bloodcells-Detection.ipynb' notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Configure the file paths in the code to match the location of the dataset on your computer.
Run the code and see the YOLOv7 model in action, detecting blood cells in real-time! Enjoy!
